# Missed Connections

See someone on the train that you'd like to reach out to but you felt too timid or shy to approach them in real life? Well, here's your second chance! By posting a note, MC gives you the opportunity to create that connection you missed out on. Party on!

## How do I use it?

To create a new connection you must be a registered user. Once you're logged in, simply navigate to your profile page to create a new connection or view existing ones.

## As a user...

*I want to choose the appropriate information (train line, station, etc) so my connection sees the post.*
  * No problem! These options are readily available on your profile page.


*I want to be able to remove a connection.*
  * Simply log in and click the 'REMOVE' button.


*I want to see everyone elses connections.*
  * Every public connection is listed on our main page.


*I want to filter by train line.*
  * Simply select the desired train line and everything else will be filtered out. Clicking 'ALL' will remove the filter and list every connection.


*I want to use this app on my phone.*
  * MC is responsive and will work on your phone/tablet!

## Technologies used

MC was composed using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript/jQuery, Backbone.js and styled with custom CSS.
